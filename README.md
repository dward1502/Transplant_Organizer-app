# Transplant_Organizer-app
React Native application that allows individuals who are on the transplant list or have had a transplant organize their lives. Features include excersize monitoring tied to apple watch/ fitbit and display in a nice UI, Nutrition monitoring and scheduling of meals, Reminder of doctor's appointments. Push notifications are essential to allow user to be reminded when these actions need to be taken, many transplant patients need to remember quite a lot of things to take and do and it is essential for life. This app will help that process along. I am on the transplant list and making this for myself and others if it is something that they would like to use.
